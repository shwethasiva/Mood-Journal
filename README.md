# MyPlanet x Girl Guides Canada Twitter Watson Tone Analyzer App

## Problem statement
GirlGuidesCanada is embarking on a massive change which will impact all of its members in some way, shape or form (~100k).  Girls, parents, Guiders or other Sr. volunteers have no centralized way to share what they feel/think about the change and we have no way to hear, analyze and consolidate 'the pulse' of the field. We need a better way to get at this information to help us make decisions in real time!

## Our solution
* Created an application that allows the client to gather data from social media
* Currently using Twitter API but scalable to other social media APIs
* We gathered data from these five hashtags:
  #GirlGuides, #GirlGuidesCanada, #GirlGuidesCookies, #GirlScouts, #MyPlanet
* We want the client to be able to hear people's thoughts and opinions on this change, therefore allowed filtering of tweets based on key words, hashtags or twitter handle.
* Analyzed the sentiment (joy, fear, sadness, disguist, anger) of each tweet body using Watson Tone Analyzer API

## Requirements

  * Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux
  * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.5 or newer
  * Text editor or IDE pre-configured with React/JSX/Flow/ESlint ([learn more](./how-to-configure-text-editors.md))

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of this project on your
local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone \
      git@github.com:hmeinertrita/MyPlanetGirlGuides.git
$ cd MyPlanetGirlGuides
```

### 2. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.


### 3. Set up MongoDB database to store tweets `react-tweets`

  1. [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  2. `use react-tweets` to create database named react-tweets
  3. Start mongo service `brew start mongodb` and `mongo`

### 4. Run `yarn start`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/build` folder. As soon as the initial build completes, it will start the
Node.js server (`node build/server.js`) and [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
with [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

> [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — Node.js server (`build/server.js`)
  with Browsersync and HMR enabled<br>
> [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) — GraphQL server and IDE<br>
> [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) — Browsersync control panel (UI)

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking away. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

Note that the `yarn start` command launches the app in `development` mode,
the compiled output files are not optimized and minimized in this case.
